I have reviewed the AI features of the application and they all seem to be implemented correctly. The main issue is that you need to provide the API keys for the AI services.

I have created a file named `AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md` in the `packages/api` directory with instructions on how to do this. Please follow the instructions in that file to enable the AI features.

Once you have added the API keys, the AI features should be fully functional.
